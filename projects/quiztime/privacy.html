        <h3>Google Play Games Services</h3>
        <p>QuizTime uses Google Play Games Services to enhance your gaming experience. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-in:</strong> We use Google Sign-in to authenticate your identity. When you sign in, we may access your public profile information, such as your display name and player ID.</li>

        <h3>Gameplay Data</h3>
        <p>Our game involves trivia questions where users guess answers using an in-game custom keyboard. We do not use the system keyboard for these inputs.
