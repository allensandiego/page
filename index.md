Seasoned Technology Professional specializing in the Oracle ecosystem, with deep functional and technical expertise across key enterprise platforms. My professional focus lies specifically in the implementation, development, and support of Oracle E-Business Suite R12, Oracle Fusion HCM, Oracle Taleo Enterprise, and Oracle Application Express (APEX). I excel at designing and developing robust, scalable Oracle solutions.

A core strength of my profile lies in enterprise application integration. I possess significant experience connecting disparate systems using industry-standard protocols, expertly leveraging both SOAP APIs and REST APIs. I am highly proficient in handling and manipulating common data interchange formats, including XML and JSON responses, ensuring seamless data flow and process automation within complex IT landscapes.

Beyond my Oracle specializations and integration skills, I maintain a versatile full-stack skill set. My background includes practical experience in automation via Bash scripting, along with development capabilities using modern languages such as Java, Python, and TypeScript. I also have experience with Android development.

Outside the realm of code and enterprise software, I apply precision and craftsmanship in hands-on hobbies like woodworking and metalworking. I also enjoy the challenging and strategic world of PC gaming, particularly 'Souls-like' titles, which reinforce my persistence and analytical approach to overcoming complex obstacles. This blend of specialized technical acumen and diverse personal interests defines my well-rounded and dedicated engineering mindset.
